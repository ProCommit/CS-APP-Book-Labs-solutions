## This is an x86-64 bomb for self-study students. 

### This lab was very educational — I loved it!
### Tools that were used to solve it:
#### 1. objdump – basic and powerful. I dumped all the disassembly into an ASM file, cut pieces of it, and wrote notes.
#### 2. pwndbg – an amazing Python extension for GDB. This was very helpful because the colors made everything very clear to the eyes, and there is a stack overview that opens while you debug, which is very helpful to connect the dots throughout the debugging process.
### I left all the notes and the pieces of the code in the solution folder.
### res.txt contains the keys to solve the challenge.
